Overview

The plugin-cosmo-play is a Node.js plugin designed for the Eliza framework, providing integration with an external backend to facilitate wallet management and interaction. This plugin will serve as an NPM package to be installed and used within projects utilizing the Eliza framework. It will handle wallet-related functionalities, including wallet creation, fetching wallet details, and registering wallets using a private key.

This document provides a detailed explanation of the plugin’s architecture, functionality, and integration methods.

Core Functionalities

The plugin-cosmo-play will provide the following core capabilities:

Wallet Creation

Generates a new wallet address and returns relevant wallet information (e.g., public key, address).

Interacts with the external backend to securely store wallet metadata or perform additional operations during creation.

Fetching Wallet Details

Retrieves detailed information about a specified wallet by querying the external backend.

Information includes balance, transaction history, and any associated metadata.

Wallet Registration via Private Key

Accepts a private key as input to associate an existing wallet with the system.

Ensures secure handling and storage of sensitive data.

Architecture and Components

1. Plugin Structure

The plugin-cosmo-play will follow the Eliza framework’s plugin architecture. The key components include:

Provider

Acts as the interface between the plugin and the external backend.

Handles all HTTP requests to the backend, such as POST (for wallet creation) and GET (for wallet details).

Actions

Implements the core functionalities (wallet creation, detail fetching, registration).

Exposes methods for interaction with the Eliza framework or other application components.

2. External Backend Integration

The plugin will require configuration to connect to an external backend API. This API will handle:

Wallet generation and registration.

Retrieval of wallet information.

Authentication and validation of requests.

Example Backend Endpoints:

POST /api/wallet/create – Creates a new wallet.

GET /api/wallet/details/{address} – Fetches details for a wallet address.

POST /api/wallet/register – Registers a wallet using a private key.

3. Configuration

The plugin will support customization through configuration options, such as:

API Base URL: The endpoint for the external backend.

Authentication Token: API keys or other credentials required for backend communication.

Timeouts and Retries: Settings for handling request timeouts and retries.

4. Security Measures

Encryption for private keys during transmission.

Token-based authentication for backend requests.

Rate limiting to prevent abuse of wallet-related actions.

Functional Workflow

1. Wallet Creation

Input: Request from the application (via Eliza).

Process: The plugin sends a request to the backend’s /wallet/create endpoint.

Output: A response containing wallet details (e.g., address, public key).

2. Fetching Wallet Details

Input: Wallet address provided by the user/application.

Process: Plugin queries the backend’s /wallet/details/{address} endpoint.

Output: Wallet balance, transaction history, and metadata.

3. Wallet Registration via Private Key

Input: Private key provided by the user.

Process: Plugin sends the key to the backend’s /wallet/register endpoint.

Output: A confirmation object with the following structure:

{
"status": "success",
"wallet": {
"address": "string",
"publicKey": "string",
"balance": "number",
"metadata": {
"createdAt": "string",
"updatedAt": "string"
}
}
}
